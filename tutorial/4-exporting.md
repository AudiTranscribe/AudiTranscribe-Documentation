# Exporting

After transcribing a file, you may want to export the transcription into a suitable format for further processing in
other applications, such as a [Digital Audio Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\_audio\_workstation).
This guide will walk you through the exporting process in AudiTranscribe.

Currently, the only supported file export format is MIDI. To export to MIDI, follow these steps:

1. Select the option under **File > Export to MIDI...**.
2. Select a destination for the MIDI file.
3. Wait for the exporting process to complete.

Congratulations! You have successfully completed the tutorial!
